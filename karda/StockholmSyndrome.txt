It is a core tenant of Buddhism that life is suffering. This much is objectively true. It is abundantly clear historically that to live was to suffer, and this holds true today. Although we have lifted the burden of poverty and starvation off of more people than ever before, and the immediate causes of what used to make us suffer are held at bay, we still find new ways to suffer. Man is not biologically designed to be happy.

Let's try a mental game. What does a lack of suffering look like? Perhaps reading a book, cozy in a bunk overlooking a garden. At best, a lack of suffering is ephemeral. After your first hit, it's all downhill. Can you picture an eternal lack of suffering, without boredom?

Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in bliss so that nothing but bubbles would dance on the surface of his bliss, as on a sea...and even then every man, out of sheer ingratitude, sheer libel, would play you some loathsome trick. He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive rationality his fatal fantastic element...simply in order to prove to himself that men still are men and not piano keys.

A friend once confided in me that he could not see the purpose in living in a sea of suffering. How does one orient oneself in such a world?

As terrible a place Hell is, it at least shows us which way is up.
Without a mountain to climb, we have no self-definition.
Without a wall to push against, we have nothing to hold on to.
Without the judging eye of Woman, we have no metric to improve ourselves by.

So, J,

improve the self to see more complex beauty
