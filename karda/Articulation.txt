Thesis: We are the first species to ever have been so smart as to articulate "We live in a society." is a stupid thing to say, and every species ever has done it.

Background:
There is this idea that humans were the first to utter the phrase "world" (or any other number of words), thus demonstrating that we are somehow special in our ability to interpret the world.
A monkey is not conscious that it is living in a society, but our ability to articulate that we are demonstrates a high level of culturally developed individual intelligence among humans, but in some sense all animals do it.

...: All species do this in some sense. A bacterium understands that it lives in a society by behaving in beneficial fashion to itself, which to a rock would look like a tour de force of intellect. Monkeys do this with social behavior, which to a bacterium would look like a tour de force of intellect. We can do this with language, which looks to most animals like a tour de force of intellect and interpretative structure of the world. Some hypothetically more intelligent agent would most definitely have an oracle-like level of understanding the lasagna-world, sort of like how jung did. (figure 1.) That painting of the lasagna-world is then this next level of intelligence, if it was indeed consciously painted. If it was painted unconsciously, then it is not a manifestation of higher intelligence but instead simply a great work of playful and true art.
